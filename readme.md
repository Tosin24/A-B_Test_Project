## Dataset Overview
This project analyzes an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert", i.e.,  the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. This project is analyzed in three (3) parts:
- Probability.
- A/B test.
- Regression.
